## Project Goals  
This project provides a minimal Python project template with a simple Hello World script and a corresponding unit test. The goal is to offer a starting point for building Python applications, including:  

- A clear folder structure (`src/` for application code and `tests/` for unit tests)  
- A minimal `setup.cfg` with configuration placeholders  
- A virtual environment initialized in the repository  
- A Hello World script demonstrating entry-level code  
- A basic unit test to illustrate how to write tests  

Feel free to expand on this template to suit your needs.
